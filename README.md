Mongoose Express CRUD Mystery

I have deloped a Node.js Express application with Typescript as the programming language, integrating MongoDB with Mongoose for user data and order management. I have ensured data integrity thorugh validation using Zod.

I have created a Node.js Project named Assignment-Two.

These are the clear instructions on how to run application locally:

First one have to clone the repository link from my github : 

This is the repository link: https://github.com/priyab99/L2-assignment-two

then open the current directory where one have colneed the git repository.

Then connect to the database mongodb

Then from the package.json file one can see all the necessary scripts to run for the project.

once the npm run start:dev one can see the application is running.

One can run it in the brower.

Then using postman api one can add requests that are given in my application.
